# Rate Calculator

A Factorio mod for calculating average production and consumption rates.

[Download on the Mod Portal.](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RateCalculator)

## Features

Rate Calculator allows you to select a region of assembling machines, furnaces, rocket silos, science labs, mining drills, offshore pumps, and / or generators to see their average production / consumption rates:

Once you do this, the rates will be calculated and displayed in a nice GUI:

Rates that depend on entities allow you to choose which entity to measure against:

Power consumption for all entities, as well as power production for solar panels and electric energy interfaces, are also calculated:

In a lot of ways, this mod is similar to [Max Rate Calculator](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/MaxRateCalculator). My goal was to improve on this concept using newer API features and performance-saving techniques, as well as have an up-to-date interface that fits right in with the other game GUIs.
