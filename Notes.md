# Notes

- Multiple selection tools for different kinds of measurements
  - Default tool selects for all measurements
  - When using a tool for a specific measurement, that measurement is auto-selected
  - Keep last used tool, or always default to all (configurable)?
- Split measurements from rates in the GUI
  - Will need different sets of rates for each measurement
- Always calculate everything so the user can switch between measurements
